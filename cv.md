#### ABOUT ME

Hello! My name is Galia and this is my CV. It's one of the tasks in my programming school.

I'm learning javascript and I am quite good in it (hope). I love programming and solving\
algorithmic problems. I'm also learning CSS and want to become a great frontend developer.\
And maybe not only frontend!
